# weCreate Widget Classes

The weCreate widget classes include an abstract class to inherit your widgets from, an interface to implement and  
a widget boilerplate based on Tom McFarlin's Widget Boilerplate. The advantage is the added cache-purging mechanisms  
found in the abstract class (more features to come)
